It was created in 2021, but the development stopped in march of 2022 after the project members run out of time. The app is still available at Play Store.\nPitch\nWe are a startup that develops an application with the purpose of enhancing the formation of bands, as well as their interaction with the public, in order to acquire greater local visibility, increasing their financial and commercial potential.\nWe believe in people\u0026rsquo;s musical talent. And although Brazil is very rich country musically, it is not always so easy to achieve the expected success. And that\u0026rsquo;s why many artists with immense talent end up being terribly undervalued!!!\nBeing a musician is a very difficult process, and goes far beyond talent. You need networking, graphic skills, knowledge in digital marketing, among many other issues, so we want to help every artist who wants to start his career, but can\u0026rsquo;t or don\u0026rsquo;t know how. In this way, we want to create an open, collaborative, equal and digital environment through an application that unites musicians. May it allow them to dream of better days again.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why we want to be the definitive tool that will create a universe in which fans and local bands can interact, grow and improve together, helping each other for a better and very promising future of a market ready to be explored. In addition, our partnerships with established bands will be a key point for us to have an exclusive resource and thus consolidate ourselves within the music scene against new competitors.\nIn short, we will increase and diversify the financial possibilities of Brazilian artists and commercial establishments, in addition to bringing them closer to the public that is really interested in listening to them. Favoring fans, bands, artists and venues so that the Brazilian music market can grow even more.\nHow it works\nWe make it possible for ordinary users to share their music and, using matches, find other people with similar musical tastes, so that they can, for example, form new friendships and never have to go to concerts alone again or even form new bands or even form a relationship.\nHaving created the fanbase, we can then attract bands by highlighting the artists closest to the user and who are grwoing. Davai also helps the bands showing map location of fans, manage band tasks and find concert opportunities so that bands and artists can increasingly improve their musical quality, worrying more about the music and less with the laborious tasks of marketing, merchandising and organization.\nIn addition to creating a monthly payment service based on the band\u0026rsquo;s fans, following the logic already consolidated by sports known as partner-fans, bringing exclusive products, discounts and services to the user, but which allows the band to have a fixed revenue, especially important for crisis like ours.\nFinally, we\u0026rsquo;ll reach out to local music-related establishments to get more data and information from their audience so they can make better decisions, and we\u0026rsquo;ll serve as an advertising platform for their events and products.\nScreenshot\nDavai App Screenshots\rTools\nAndroid Studio Dart Figma Firebase Flutter Github Google Cloud Platform Google Maps plugin Google Play Store Revenue Cat Startup SQL Wix ","date":"March 10, 2022","hero":"/images/projects/davai.png","permalink":"https://marcos14almeida.github.io/posts/projects/davai/","summary":"Development\nStart: 01/2021.\nEnd: 03/2022.\nProject Description(Link to PlayStore)\nI am the founder with 2 more colleagues of the Davai app. It\u0026rsquo;s a music social network, developed to help people to find friends based on their music taste and help bands to find their audience.

However, the project was deactivated because we decided to buy boards from another company.\nIt must be added that I also worked with other robots like \u0026ldquo;Spartacus\u0026rdquo; a ramp fight robot.

It consists of a series of LEDs arranged in a linear configuration. The incoming audio signal from a device, such as a cell phone, is filtered into different frequency ranges using transistors. Each LED is associated with a specific frequency range, and when the audio signal falls within that range, the corresponding LED lights up. The LED signals are amplified and transmitted to a speaker, allowing the LEDs to light up in synchronization with the music being played from the connected device. This creates an engaging visual representation of the audio, where the LEDs illuminate and change intensity in response to the music\u0026rsquo;s frequencies.\nScreenshot\nTools\nSpeaker LEDs Capacitors Homemade board Transistors Analogic Blinking LEDs Development\nStart: -/2012.\nEnd: -/2012.\nProject description\nAn analog blink circuit, also known as an astable multivibrator, is an electronic circuit that generates a continuous blinking or oscillating output signal. It typically consists of two transistors, capacitors, resistors, and a power supply.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how it works:\nInitial State: The circuit begins in an unstable state where one transistor is in the \u0026ldquo;ON\u0026rdquo; state (conducting) and the other is in the \u0026ldquo;OFF\u0026rdquo; state (non-conducting).\nCapacitor Charging: The capacitor connected to the \u0026ldquo;ON\u0026rdquo; transistor starts to charge through a resistor. As the voltage across the capacitor increases, it eventually reaches a threshold level.\nSwitching Transistors: Once the threshold voltage is reached, it triggers a switch, causing the \u0026ldquo;ON\u0026rdquo; transistor to turn off and the \u0026ldquo;OFF\u0026rdquo; transistor to turn on.\nCapacitor Discharging: The capacitor connected to the \u0026ldquo;OFF\u0026rdquo; transistor starts to discharge through another resistor. As the voltage across the capacitor decreases, it eventually drops below a threshold level.\nSwitching Transistors Again: Once the threshold voltage is reached, it triggers another switch, causing the \u0026ldquo;OFF\u0026rdquo; transistor to turn off and the \u0026ldquo;ON\u0026rdquo; transistor to turn on again.\nRepeat Cycle: The process repeats, with the transistors switching back and forth in an oscillating manner. This results in a continuous blinking or oscillating output signal.\nBy adjusting the values of the resistors and capacitors in the circuit, you can control the frequency and duty cycle of the blinking signal. Although simple the analog blink circuit is very used in applications such as blinking LEDs, timers, and oscillators.\nScreenshot\nTools\nLEDs Homemade board ","date":"December 10, 2014","hero":"/images/projects/electronics.jpg","permalink":"https://marcos14almeida.github.io/posts/projects/electronics/","summary":"TCC Liceu Development\nStart: 09/2014.\nEnd: 11/2014.\nProject description\nThis work aims at the implementation of electronic concepts for the creation of a project that assists the parking of an automotive vehicle.

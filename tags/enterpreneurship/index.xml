Project Description(Link to PlayStore)
I am the founder with 2 more colleagues of the Davai app. It&amp;rsquo;s a music social network, developed to help people to find friends based on their music taste and help bands to find their audience. It was created in 2021, but the development stopped in march of 2022 after the project members run out of time. The app is still available at Play Store.</description>

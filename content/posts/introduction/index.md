Welcome to my data scientist portfolio website! 

I am thrilled to share my passion for data science, analytics, and problem-solving with you.

As a data scientist, I have dedicated my career to extracting insights from complex data sets, uncovering meaningful patterns, and driving data-driven decision-making. This website serves as a platform to showcase my projects, skills, and expertise in various domains of data science. From predictive modeling and machine learning to data visualization and statistical analysis, I strive to bring value to organizations through the power of data.

In addition, I am very interested in other areas of knowledge such as entrepreneurship, marketing, electronics, IoT and 5G networks. My trajectory shows a little of my skills and results in each of these areas and I hope you feel part of all the projects I've created to date.

Join me on this journey as we explore the fascinating world of data science and its endless possibilities.

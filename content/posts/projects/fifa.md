## Fifa C Game

**Project description**

It started in 2014 as a game made with C programming languages. You could transfer players and play a league mode. Then I also implemented a champions league and copa libertadores simulator where you didn't play as a manager but could simulate this tournaments for many years and see who would be the champions, top goal scorer etc...


## Fifa 2021

**Project description**

In 2021, I learned how to make flutter apps. Therefore, I decided to improved my old game and made an app with graphics and original crests, kits, stadium of 200 different teams. I also implemented a web scrapper algorithm in python where I took real data from football players from two different websites, then I saved these data in a .csv and imported to the game. 



## F-Sim

**Project description**

Football Simulator style game in Flutter, for Android devices, still in development. The archive contains hundreds of images of official clubs and leagues, which is why the archive is large and not available on the Play Store due to license issues.

**How to use Project**

Choose a team and manage your team by hiring players to win matches and win titles. As a differential, the application offers the possibility of quickly simulating the seasons, being great for studying how football would change over the years. In addition, the user has the possibility to customize any team, player or league.

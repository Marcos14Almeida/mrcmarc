**Development**

Start: 03/2021.

End: 06/2021.


**Project description**

In 2021, I participated in the Unicamp Challenge, organized by the Inova Unicamp Innovation Agency. Anyone over the age of 18 can enroll in teams of 3 to 5 participants in the Unicamp Challenge, an entrepreneurship, technology and innovation competition with prizes of up to R$30,000.

The objective of the competition is to train people interested in entrepreneurship so that they can create new sustainable businesses based on university technologies. To this end, workshops, lectures, mentoring and workshops are offered over the course of three months to help participants advance in the development of a business plan.

During the competition, the registered teams develop a business model based on a list of Unicamp technologies made available by the organization and chosen by the team.

I did the project in a group of 4 people. We chose to create a business model based on a soil moisture sensor. The present invention relates to a resistive sensor used to measure soil moisture with applications ranging from disaster prevention, such as breaking barriers, to
applications in irrigation systems. The invention falls within the field of electrochemistry with application in the field of soil science.

We've done the first step of creating a report by creating a business model canvas. However, we were not approved for the next stage due to the lack of attractiveness of the market, since in our several attempts to sell it to the agricultural market were not successful.

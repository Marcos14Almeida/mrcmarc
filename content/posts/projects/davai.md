**Development**

Start: 01/2021.

End: 03/2022.


**Project Description**([Link to PlayStore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.davai.davai_app&pli=1))


I am the founder with 2 more colleagues of the Davai app. It's a music social network, developed to help people to find friends based on their music taste and help bands to find their audience. It was created in 2021, but the development stopped in march of 2022 after the project members run out of time. The app is still available at Play Store.

**Pitch**

We are a startup that develops an application with the purpose of enhancing the formation of bands, as well as their interaction with the public, in order to acquire greater local visibility, increasing their financial and commercial potential.

We believe in people's musical talent. And although Brazil is very rich country musically, it is not always so easy to achieve the expected success. And that's why many artists with immense talent end up being terribly undervalued!!!

Being a musician is a very difficult process, and goes far beyond talent. You need networking, graphic skills, knowledge in digital marketing, among many other issues, so we want to help every artist who wants to start his career, but can't or don't know how. In this way, we want to create an open, collaborative, equal and digital environment through an application that unites musicians. May it allow them to dream of better days again.

That's why we want to be the definitive tool that will create a universe in which fans and local bands can interact, grow and improve together, helping each other for a better and very promising future of a market ready to be explored. In addition, our partnerships with established bands will be a key point for us to have an exclusive resource and thus consolidate ourselves within the music scene against new competitors.

In short, we will increase and diversify the financial possibilities of Brazilian artists and commercial establishments, in addition to bringing them closer to the public that is really interested in listening to them. Favoring fans, bands, artists and venues so that the Brazilian music market can grow even more.

**How it works**

We make it possible for ordinary users to share their music and, using matches, find other people with similar musical tastes, so that they can, for example, form new friendships and never have to go to concerts alone again or even form new bands or even form a relationship.

Having created the fanbase, we can then attract bands by highlighting the artists closest to the user and who are grwoing. Davai  also helps the bands showing map location of fans, manage band tasks and find concert opportunities so that bands and artists can increasingly improve their musical quality, worrying more about the music and less with the laborious tasks of marketing, merchandising and organization.

In addition to creating a monthly payment service based on the band's fans, following the logic already consolidated by sports known as partner-fans, bringing exclusive products, discounts and services to the user, but which allows the band to have a fixed revenue, especially important for crisis like ours.

Finally, we'll reach out to local music-related establishments to get more data and information from their audience so they can make better decisions, and we'll serve as an advertising platform for their events and products.

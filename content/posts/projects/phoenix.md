Start: 03/2017.

End: 06/2019.


**The competition**

In the robotics team, I participated in the 2017 and 2018 editions of the Winter Challenge.
Occurring once a year the Winter Challenge is one of the biggest robotics competitions in all of Latin America. It involves real competitions between robots, such as mortal fights, boxing, or even racing. The competition is organized by RoboCore, a renowned electronics parts manufacturer and seller. Competitions can be automatic robots or radio frequency control. Among the categories, there are:

**Combat**: in which robots fight to destroy opponents using weapons and strategies;

**Sumo**: in which robots simulate the sport divided into weight categories and types of control;

**Hockey**: in general the match requires that the robots are designed to push or throw the puck towards the goal, this competition only contains one category;

**Line follower**: classic speed competition in which robots are encouraged to follow a path in the shortest time;

**Robot Trakking**: in this competition the robots must move around a lawn and try to find the shortest path between three predefined markings;

**ArtBot-Kinetic**: is a visual competition with the intention of entertaining the public, in which the participants must strive for creativity;

**Soccer competition**: is subdivided into physical and simulated categories where robots participate in soccer matches.

Piranha Trakking Robot
----------------------

**Project description**

The Piranha trakking robot was 1st in 2017 and 3rd at Winter Challenge 2018. I did the documentation for the Piranha trakking robot project, helped reorganize the electrical part. And I added hall sensors by installing magnets on all wheels, to help count wheel turns, and thus control the speed and orientation of the robot.

I also spent 3 months developing in Altium a new control board to substitute our NXP boards. However, the project was deactivated because we decided to buy boards from another company. 

It must be added that I also worked with other robots like "Spartacus" a ramp fight robot. I developed a flamethrower for the robot, but it was never used on the robot due to lack of space and for safety reasons.

Marketing Coordinator
---------------------

Between 2018 and 2019 I was the marketing coordinator. I made important contributions by creating the new team website, the format which remains until today: https://www.phoenixunicamp.com.br/. In addition, I made the team's t-shirts and blouses, flyers, posts on social networks, contact with sponsors and organization of selection processes

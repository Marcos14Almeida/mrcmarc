**Development**

Start: 08/2022.

End: Work In Progress...


**Project description**

I'm doing a master's degree at the [Intrig](https://intrig.dca.fee.unicamp.br/) electrical engineering group at Unicamp. My goal is to create a digital twin network from the fiber optic networks of the company PadTec from Campinas.

I participated in the application of a gradient descent algorithm on the digital twin. And at the moment I am collecting practical data from the network in order to model the network with real data.


**Tools**
- Gitlab
- Python
- Optical Fibers
- Network Digital Twin
- Sphinx


Conferences
-----------

**Globecom**

In december 2022 I attended Globecom in Rio de Janeiro.

IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM) is one of the IEEE Communications Society’s two flagship conferences dedicated to driving innovation in nearly every aspect of communications. Each year, more than 3000 scientific researchers and their management submit proposals for program sessions to be held at the annual conference. The best of the proposals are selected for the conference program, which includes technical papers, tutorials, workshops and industry sessions designed specifically to advance technologies, systems and infrastructure that are continuing to reshape the world and provide all users with access to an unprecedented spectrum of high-speed, seamless and cost-effective global telecommunications services.

**SBRC**

In may 2023 I attended SBRC in Brasília.

The Brazilian Symposium on Computer Networks and Distributed Systems (SBRC) is an annual event held by the Brazilian Computing Society (SBC) and the Computer Networks Laboratory (LARC). Over more than four decades, the SBRC has established itself as the most important national scientific event in computer networks and distributed systems, reaching an international scope with the presence of researchers, technicians and scientists from Latin America and the world.

**SBRC - Hackathon SMARTNESS**

I helped in the organization of the SMARTNESS Hackathon / 5G Dataset Challenge aims to instigate the development of innovative solutions and elaboration of insights using bases (provided by the SMARTNESS Hackathon organizing committee) composed of data from the use of adaptive video streaming services (YouTube) and 5G networks in the Brazil. To support problem resolution, teams will be able to use auxiliary databases to enrich data.

Teams will be able to develop their projects along several lines, such as exploratory data analysis, development of innovative insights using 5G and the available datasets, Machine Learning models for prediction, classification, clustering, decision support, development application performance models in the context of 5G and much more.

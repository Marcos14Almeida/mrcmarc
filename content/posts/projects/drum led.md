**Development**

Start: 03/2020.

End: 06/2020.


**Project description**

During the pandemic in 2020, I had the idea and dream of putting LEDs on my battery. After 2 months I finished the project. I mounted an arduino circuit on a board, with selector buttons for the code executed in the microcontroller. The toms and floor use an Arduino-controlled RGB LED, which can be programmed in tune with the music or played in random modes. The snare drum uses a piezoelectric to light up the LED strip as I play.

The board was designed with Altium, the code made with Arduino and the board was homemade. The total cost was less than R$150 with all the leds, box and components.

I have an youtube channel where I play some drum covers. ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jym8Rs1Fpf4&ab_channel=MarcosAlmeida))

**Development**

Start: 03/2016.

End: 08/2016.


**Project description**

My first project using python was to create a telemetry system for UNICAMP's e-racing team building electric cars for student competitions. I had to collect the data from several telemetry .csv files collected with GPS data and then get the car performance metric by dividing the track into 3 sections.

I also developed some electric 3d components in SolidWorks and help in the cost report containing all car parts with their quantities, prices and technical drawing.

**Development**

Start: 07/2020.

End: 10/2020.


**Project description**

During the pandemics, I bought a guitar and saw that guitar pedals were extremely expensive. However, there were sites on the internet that taught how to create your own project, including ready-made layouts. However I decided to do a simpler version of gain distortion. In three months, I developed the board in Altium, fabricated the board in-house, soldered the components together, and put everything together in a box. The project was half the price of buying an original.

This pedal was used for over a year, until I finally decided to buy another pedal with more distortion effects.

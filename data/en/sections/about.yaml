# a summary about you
summary: | 
    I am a passionate about machine learning and I'm always doing projects and researching. The possibility of having an idea that can help someone is what motivates me to work and learn about data science every day. 
    
    Currently I'm working with SGD optimization in the development of a fiber optics network digital twin for my master's thesis.
